## About
I am recent MEng graduate from Imperial College London, entering the music technology industry. I have a personal passion for Music Production, DJing and Digital Arts. I have been exploring these areas of interest through projects that employ my strong technical foundations in DSP, Embedded Systems and Machine Learning.
